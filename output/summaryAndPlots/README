Notations:
- v0: first version where in each step of the optimisation the labels (z) are always constrained to be zhat
- v1: second version where optimisation iteratively optimise the inducing inputs (M-step) and assign z to zhat (E-step). The objective values do not always decrease in this implementation.
- v2: similar to v1 but assignments in E-step are only accepted if that decreases the objective values.
- kmeans: local fitc with kmeans clustering
- random: local fitc with random clustering
- zhat: assignments of points to nearest clusters
- zmap: map assignments
- rpc : initialisation of inducing points and clusters with recursive projection clustering

Most experiments are ran with maha (shared diagonal covariance)
